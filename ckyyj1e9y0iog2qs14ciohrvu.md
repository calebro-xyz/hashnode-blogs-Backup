## 55 Web3 Projects Worth Following - Best Web 3.0 Examples

As we slowly transition from the current generation of the web to the next, most of us still find it hard to identify web3 sites. 

In this article, we are going to list web3 examples that you can easily get started with and become an early adopter of the future of the web.

We will also break down how the web has transformed since its inception so that you can have a clear picture of where we are currently heading and how you can be a part of this journey too.

The web3 website examples we are about to explore cover all the core features of Web3, i.e Defi, [DAOs](https://web3.hashnode.com/what-is-a-dao-decentralized-autonomous-organizations-explained), blockchain infrastructure platforms, smart contract platforms, and social networks built on the blockchain.

Let’s explore examples of web3 websites in each of the categories.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

![DeFi gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/nD54v1pclkS8uCi9WR/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

DeFi is a collective term that describes financial services that are built on the blockchain network. DeFi is an alternative to banking systems that are controlled by the Central Banks.

DeFi systems are built on the principles of:

- **Openness**- Everyone can be part of it, with no restriction based on location, country, region, or financial power.

- **Fast **- Fast transfer of monetary assets.

- **Transparency **– Anyone can look at a product's data and inspect how the system works.

- **The market is always open**.

## DeFi web3 websites

## [Aave](https://aave.com)

**What is DAO?**

![DAO meme](https://media.giphy.com/media/UT2HdKPXukBJjypvwy/giphy.gif)

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO) is a type of organization that has no central authority. Its day-to-day operations are governed by a smart contract on the blockchain. Decision-making is done by the members of the DAO based on their voting rights.

## Importance of DAOs

- **No central authority** - Unlike most corporations that have a hierarchy of leadership, everyone in a DAO has a say in the future of the organization.

- **Open financial transaction** - Financial activities of a DAO are recorded on the blockchain. Everyone can access and read how their investments were used.

- **Democratic** - Just like most web3 projects are community-driven, the two main voting systems in a DAO are Holographic Consensus and Token-based quorum voting.

- **Flexible decision making** - Traditional organizations have a bureaucratic way of making decisions, for example, financial decisions have to through the approval of 4-6 personnel before it is approved since DAOs do not have a centralized governing body.

Let’s explore some of the most notable DAOs that are currently active:

## [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/)

## What is Web1?

![A screenshot of an example of web1](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641366187287/bPjLin6Zj.jpeg)

Web1 is the first generation of the web that spanned from the early 90s to the early 2000s. This generation was characterized by static HTML websites that were read-only.  

## What is Web2?

![Web2 social media icons](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1641370422164/ZSwtl-WRw.png)

Web2 is the web as we know it today. Web2 was meant to address the shortcomings of web1. As the adoption of the web rapidly increased, there was a need to have an interactive, collaborative and dynamic website that does more than just give users the ability to view content. 

Some web2 examples are social media network platforms like [facebook](facebook.com), [twitter](https://twitter.com), [pinterest](https://pinterest.com), and [Reddit](https://reddit.com). FinTech websites like [Paypal](https://paypal.com) and [square](https://square.com), Blogging platforms like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) and (Medium)[https://medium.com].

## Web3 Definition: What is Web3?

![web3 gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/sYWsNFFqResfbZpywL/giphy.gif)

The second generation of the web still had its own set of shortcomings. Web2 users did not have control of how and where their data was stored and used. This led to big tech and their advertising partners bombarding their users with targeted ads.

Even with massive strides in the finance technology(FinTech) sector, the transfer of monetary assets has still not been the smoothest. Security issues, high transaction fees, government regulations, and unavailability in some parts of the world are some of the FinTech issues web3 DeFi websites are looking to solve.

So what exactly is Web 3? Web3 is the new iteration of the World Wide Web that encompasses decentralized systems, semantic web technologies, ubiquitous DeFi systems powered by cryptocurrencies, and community ownership of the web.

## Benefits of Web3

###  Decentralized 
Web3 is set to revolutionize ownership of data and systems. In the current past, data and systems are owned by major tech organizations. This means that they can use your data for target advertisement, in some cases, even violating the privacy of the users.

Web3 is web by the people and for the people, meaning the governance of the web is in the hands of the community. Communication takes place in a peer-to-peer network on the blockchain, rather than through centralized operations.

### Openness

Censorship has been a major challenge in this generation of the web. Over time, central authorities have abused their power and blocked access to some resources on the internet based on political, economical, and social differences.

Decentralized systems have no central governing authority, meaning, no one can manipulate them for profit or power.

### Permission-less

One of the greatest challenges of the current web is the authentication mechanism of web applications (the need to have multiple passwords on every different platform). This becomes a very tedious and insecure way of verification.

With decentralized applications(Dapps), all you need to do to participate in the blockchain is to create a crypto wallet and connect your wallet to the application.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have explored the evolution of the web and the possible adoption of web3. In this article, we also go through 55 examples of web3 websites, and their different use cases, such as DeFi, social network, DAOs, and infrastructure. 

Hopefully, this article will guide you, and help you explore and experiment with the new world of the decentralized and open web.
