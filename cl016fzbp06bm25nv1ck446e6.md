## A Handpicked List of The 55 Top NFT Artists in 2022

## How are NFTs changing art?

If you’re a regular user of the web, you’re probably familiar with NFTs. 

If you’re not, we can summarize the definition of an NFT to a digital asset that **cannot** be interchanged for another digital asset of the same kind.

NFT art has a huge advantage over traditional art. 

This is because NFT art can be anything from an image, music, or video, to a simple tweet or word.

 NFT art has also allowed everyone to be part of the community; you don’t have to be a renowned artist for people to embrace your art.

So how exactly are NFTs different from traditional art?

## Problems NFTs are fixing

1. **Ownership and authenticity**: NFTs are [minted through smart contracts](https://web3.hashnode.com/glossary/what-are-smart-contracts) that assign ownership and manage the transferability of the art. Ownership can also be verified on the blockchain anytime.

2. **Empowering artists**: NFTs have made it very easy for digital artists to get rewarded for their work and connect with their fans. With NFTs, you only need a crypto wallet to connect with marketplaces before you can start selling your art. No gatekeepers at all.

3. **Easily transferable**: Selling and buying NFT tokens is easy. It only requires one to have internet access, and enough funds in their crypto wallet to purchase or bid an NFT piece.
