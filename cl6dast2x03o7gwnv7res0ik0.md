## What is the Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP)?

##  Introduction

As everyday crypto users, we may sometime fail to understand how we can leverage blockchain technology and NFTs beyond images of apes to real-life use cases. One very promising application of NFTs that has utility is the Proof of Attendance Protocol(PoAP).

How many times have you attended a conference and wished you had taken something to mark the occasion, or during the pandemic when all events were online?

Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) is a protocol that generates an attendance badge or a digital collectible of an event a user attended. 

Proof of Attendance Protocols(collectibles) are minted as NFTs and are stored on the blockchain.

## Proof of Attendance Protocol(PoAP): Where can they be used?

PoAPs were first used in 2019  at ETHDencer conference but the applications of PoAPs are endless, here are some of the most practical use cases for PoAPs.

1. Concerts - Concerts might be the most direct way in which PoAPs are used.

2. Sporting Events - After participating in a sporting event, without a medal or picture, it is impossible to show that you part of that event, PoAPs solve this. 

3. Graduations - An immutable record of graduation in the form of NFTs will be more valuable and verifiable compared to a physical graduation certificate. 

4. PoAPs for Community - PoAPs' use cases extend beyond ticketing and events, they can also be used to prove membership of a certain group of people or even a political party.

## Why you should use PoAP

1. PoAPs are tradable - Yes, PoAPs are tradable and exchangeable such as any other NFT this might be useful in a community where the number of seats is regulated.

2. Privacy - POAps are minted just as you do ordinary NFTs, this means your personal information will not be exposed to rogue marketers.

3. Incentivize ownership - With PoAPs it's very easy to reward loyal attendees of a concert or event through discounts or gift cards.
